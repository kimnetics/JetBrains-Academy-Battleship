# JetBrains Academy Battleship Project

An example of a passing solution to the final phase of the JetBrains Academy Java Battleship project.

## Description

To satisfy the needs of the JetBrains Academy solution tester, all the code is within a single file. The wording of the text messages for the most part is exactly as specified in the project specification as this is part of the testing.

The rules for positioning of ships is different than the board game. The project specification requires that ships not touch each other. I suggest adjusting that bit of code if you actually want to play a normal board game style version of Battleship.
